# Elektronika od podstaw

*Elektronika od podstaw* is a polish serious game, developed as part of a university course project. It introduces players to the fundamentals of electrical circuits. The game’s goal is to teach basic principles and laws of electricity through interactive problem-solving tasks. It is intended for high school students, first-year engineering undergraduates, and anyone interested in learning the foundational concepts of electrical engineering, power systems, and electronics.

Some visual materials used in this game originate from the textbook *Ciekawi świata. Fizyka 2. Podręcznik. Część 1. Zakres rozszerzony. Szkoły ponadgimnazjalne* by Grzegorz Kornaś, published by Wydawnictwo Pedagogiczne Operon, and from the YouTube video [The Big Misconception About Electricity](https://youtu.be/bHIhgxav9LY?t=481) on the Veritasium channel. **These materials have been used solely for educational purposes.**
